## Purpose

This repository is a learning experiment focused on building a modern, developer-friendly CLI tool in Go ‚Äî heavily inspired by glab (). The goal is to dive deep into the process of creating a production-grade command-line application using idiomatic Go, modular design, and common CLI best practices. While this project may evolve into something functional and reusable, its primary purpose is educational: to explore Go's capabilities for CLI development, improve familiarity with Go modules, testing, package layout.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer on Borrowed/Inspired Code

Some portions of this codebase are borrowed or adapted from the glab project (the official GitLab CLI). All credit for those parts goes to the original authors and maintainers of glab.

This project is strictly intended for learning and experimentation. I do not claim ownership or authorship of any borrowed code ‚Äî it is used here solely to better understand how professional-grade Go CLI tools are structured and implemented.

If this project ever evolves beyond a personal learning tool, all borrowed code will be either replaced or properly attributed in compliance with licensing terms.
